# Cache Converters

Cache Converters is an application that allows you to easily convert the contents of Discord's Cache Folder to PNG files. The intention of this is to make it slightly easier to find deleted images from Discord.

Currently, this application is only available on Windows, however, I am considering making a Linux version of this program somewhere in the future.

# Installation & Usage

To use Cache Converters, simply download a Pre-Compiled Release from the <a href="https://github.com/105hua/Cache-Converters/releases">Releases</a> section and copy the contents of the ZIP folder to a directory of your choice. After that, run the .exe file and the process should complete automatically. The application usually does not take too long to run, however, a Cache directory that's large in size may take longer.

It's also worth mentioning that each release includes a changelog, so if you're into that, it's there for you.
